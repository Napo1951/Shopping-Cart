<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is an exercise showing the list of items on a shopping cart that the user(s) can add and/or remove on a cart before purchasing. It allows the stock keeper to restock back to original quantity on the instock, because once you reach the number available in stock, users will receive a message saying that not available in stock</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>To get started, please click this link https://napo1951.github.io/Shopping-Cart/ which will take you to the exercise for testing.</p>
<h2> Future Improvements</h2>
<p>More items could be added, refactoring a way to show the user(s) balance (like online ordering) and possibly show dectuctables. Also, CSS coulb be added somehow to update the background-color.</p>
